# What is this?
a tiny impractical esoteric programming language i made because i was bored

## How to run this?
on linux:
1. get g++
2. `./build.sh`
3. `./out/stackl`

on windows:
1. get g++
2. 'g++ stackl.cpp -o stackl.exe'
3. run stackl.exe

## How to use it?
i don't know yet, this is heavily in-dev and for now not really usable for anything, i'll see
